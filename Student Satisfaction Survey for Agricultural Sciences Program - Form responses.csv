As an international student (paying more than double the fees), I struggled a lot finding internship and WIL didn't offer any help. WIL should provide more resources and help students in finding internships, share more opportunities and assist them in securing an internship. 

The course should include more hands-on components (like on-field, in soil and plants) in their curriculum so students could get more expertise. 

However, the lab sessions by all units were fabuolous particularly the ones related to soil sciences. These labs were highly organised and offered much exposure to what's happening around. 

SCIE2205 was a wonderful unit. University should provide more emphasize on it as it really help students to better understand the industry for which they're getting ready.

GENE2205 was not quite efficient in explaining the concepts. It felt like it was moving too quick and also, most students barely passed. Not many understood the concepts and the principles. Even the labs weren't effective in explaining the concepts. Maybe one more genetics unit should be added - one as base (covering very fundamentals) and then move on the higher one.",,,6362998164312917190

Might be better to look into the scholarship warakirri give curtin a bit (~$10k and must work over harvest after sem for two seasons paid market rates) 

UWA sells its ag courses as the best for broad acre dryland cropping anywhere. Would be great to see specific core units for this the whole way through degree. Anyone at uni for animal stuff is at murdoch and lots of crossover to manage a pasture/feed crop. Agri1101 is good but not specific. 
Individual units giving competency in spray recommendations, fertiliser/nutrition management (then built on later with the biology/soil sciences that are already in unit), basic structural/mechanical engineering, robotics or hands-on electrical engineering.

I think a compulsory unit on work placement for a year or semester would be highly beneficial. If the degree was an extra year but offered placement for a year I think it would be highly beneficial and enticing to students, Marcus Oldham in VIC have a model like this, and it is a very competitive program to get into with students from across the country applying. Even for international students, agriculture in WA is quite foreign from the agriculture in their own countries and some experience on farm/in industry would be ideal fro them.","80,000",23784737,6364042842379794693
